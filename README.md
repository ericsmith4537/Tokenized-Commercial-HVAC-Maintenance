# Tokenized Commercial HVAC Maintenance

A blockchain-based platform for transparent, efficient, and accountable commercial HVAC system maintenance.

## Overview

The Tokenized Commercial HVAC Maintenance platform leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize how commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems are maintained. By tokenizing key aspects of HVAC maintenance, this solution creates an immutable record of equipment history, service compliance, technician qualifications, and system performanceâ€”driving accountability and efficiency across the maintenance lifecycle.

## Core Smart Contracts

### System Registration Contract
- Records comprehensive details of heating and cooling equipment
- Maintains immutable equipment history and specifications
- Stores installation dates, warranty information, and lifecycle data
- Generates unique digital identifiers for each system component

### Service Schedule Contract
- Defines required maintenance intervals based on manufacturer recommendations
- Automates service notifications and compliance tracking
- Manages dynamic maintenance schedules based on usage patterns
- Enables condition-based maintenance triggers through IoT integration

### Technician Verification Contract
- Validates qualified service providers through credential verification
- Maintains technician certification records and specializations
- Tracks service quality metrics and completion history
- Enables reputation-based technician selection

### Performance Tracking Contract
- Monitors system efficiency and operational parameters
- Records energy consumption patterns and anomalies
- Identifies potential issues before system failure occurs
- Provides data-driven insights for optimization
